      "Hogwarts Legacy is a very mediocre, generic and formulaic modern open world game that's saved from being a bad game by the Harry Potter license. They've done a good job of recreating Hogwarts and it is honestly really cool being able to fly around and above the castle on your broom seamlessly. I had fun in my first several hours playing the game just exploring the castle and the areas outside around the castle like hogsmeade. The more you progress though the more you realise how little the game has to offer. One of the biggest offenders is how lifeless the world feels with the lack of interaction in general. I compare it to Bully which came out 17 years ago now. When you walk around the school in Bully it feels like you are a part of that world. There is a time mechanic where you need to get to class on time and go to bed on time etc. All the NPC's have their routine they're following making you feel like the world is moving regardless of you being there rather than it feeling like the world is waiting for you like it does in Hogwarts Legacy. The difference between the level of interaction compared to a game released in 2006 is honestly really sad but that's just one of my many complaints. The general lack of role playing is also a big issue, you don't feel like a student in this world at all. You go to class like less than a dozen times from what i recall just to learn spells so you can go on mass killings in the world. The story and writing in general is lackluster, lack of well written characters to latch on to and connect with to pull you through the story. Main character has no personality. No consequences for your actions and choices have zero impact on the outcome in the end. Combat gets extremely repetitive and tiresome. The R2/RT spam is ridiculous i felt like i was on autopilot throughout most of the combat. The lack of enemy variety didn't help either. The gear system is terrible because of the level scaling making exploration pointless knowing you will never find a really good item that will last you dozens of hours because everything is scaled to your level. There is nothing interesting to see outside of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade because of all the bland check list side activities they've added to pad out the length. Boring level and puzzle design in the caves and dungeons. UI feels like it's ripped straight out of a modern Ubisoft game. Graphics are inconsistent, sometimes it looks like a good looking PS4 game and other times it looks like an early PS3 game. The performance is awful because of the amount of VRAM it uses, i had to find a fix online for my RTX 3070 8gb because it ate all my VRAM like it was nothing. Maybe it's justified if the game looked amazing but it doesn't. The game overall doesn't feel like it's a full price Triple A game, it feels like a budget title. Makes sense that the developers last game was Cars 3. 4/10 (Mediocre)\n"
